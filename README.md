# Software Development Exercise
---

### Exercise Overview
The goal of this exercise is to build a simple web application that allows a user to browse and manage a database of artist and related album information.

### Methodology
This exercise is designed to test the candidate’s development workflow and skill level at various aspects of the overall solution. It is intended that the candidate ask questions, use internet resources, and ask for general guidance from LBMC personnel during the exercise as needed. The instructions are purposefully minimal to allow the candidate to use discretion about how the solution should be completed.

### Development Guidelines
The following technologies should be used but alternates can be considered too. 

  1. SQL Server

  2. ASP.Net WebForms or ASP.Net MVC

  3. Visual Studio

Additional libraries may be used at the discretion of the candidate.

### Database Design
Using the screenshot in the screen mockups section, design and implement a simple database to hold the information needed to display artist and album information as shown.

### UI Design
The design in the screenshot (layout, colors, etc.) can be implemented as shown or the candidate can improve the design as they see appropriate. 

The only requirements for the design are as follows:

  1. Must demonstrate a table-less design on the artist listing screen. Must use div’s to create the left and right panes of the layout as shown above.
